AngularJS-Jasmine-Karma
=======================

This basic structure is used as base template up and running WebApp with AngularJS + Jasmime.

Karma runner is optional. Just write "karma start".

If you just want jasmine without Karma make sure you work with testrunner.html in your browser.

Remember there is one branch for Karma deployment (master) and jasmine standalone without Karma (jasmine_only).
